# Public repository of all project code and results

The geometric extension for a ridge filter consisting of ridgepins can be found under /topas_extensions. 

The python files can all be run when creating a virtual environment through python `-m venv env` and installing all the needed modules by first activating the venv through `. env/bin/activate`. 
Then install all the modules through `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

The bulk of the python code is in `geneticAlgorithm.py` it pulls from most of the other python files, though this repository has not been cleaned entirely.
